"""WebSocket endpoint for job progress updates.

Wire protocol
-------------
Server → client messages are JSON objects. Every progress/slide_ready/
complete/error frame carries a monotonically increasing ``seq`` (per job)
and ``ts`` (server epoch seconds), assigned in :mod:`session.manager`.

Connection lifecycle:

1. Client opens ``/ws/{job_id}?since_seq=<int>``. ``since_seq`` defaults
   to 0 and represents the last seq the client has already processed.
2. Server immediately sends a ``snapshot`` event reflecting current job
   state, then replays any retained events with ``seq > since_seq``.
3. Server then streams new events as they arrive.
4. Server emits ``{"type": "ping", "ts": ...}`` every ``HEARTBEAT_SECONDS``
   so reverse proxies and browsers don't tear the socket down during long
   silent stages. Clients can ignore pings (or echo them as ``pong``).

If the underlying job has reached a terminal state and there is nothing
left to deliver, the server closes the socket cleanly.
